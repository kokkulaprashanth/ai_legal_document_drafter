# Advanced Legal Document Drafting System

This application is a Streamlit-based tool for generating legal documents and providing legal assistance, tailored for Indian law. It allows users to specify various legal document parameters, and the system leverages OpenAI's API to generate legally accurate drafts. Users can interact with the application to generate documents, download them as PDFs, and get answers to legal queries.

## Features

1. **Document Generation**: Generate legal documents like plaints, petitions, affidavits, and more by entering details such as case information, parties involved, court details, relevant clauses, and applicable laws.
2. **Clause Selection**: Includes predefined sample clauses (specific to Indian legal contexts), with an option to add custom clauses.
3. **PDF Export**: Download generated documents as PDF files.
4. **AI-Powered Legal Assistance**: Ask questions about Indian law related to the generated document and receive responses from an AI legal assistant.
